## 🎓 Interview Talking Points

**"Tell me about this project"**
> "APIWatch automates API debugging workflows. When support engineers help customers with API integrations, they spend hours manually testing endpoints and deciphering error codes. APIWatch reduces that to minutes with automated diagnosis, smart retries, and clear reporting."

**"What was the biggest challenge?"**
> "Designing the diagnosis engine to provide actionable suggestions rather than just error codes. I mapped common HTTP failures to specific troubleshooting steps, making it useful for both technical and non-technical users."

**"Why these technologies?"**
> "Python for rapid development, requests library for reliability, FastAPI for the webhook server's performance, Jinja2 for flexible HTML templating, and YAML for human-readable test configuration."
